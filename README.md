# 2DVoxelEngine
An old project to create 2D Voxel Engine similar to Terraria, without using anything but a basic graphics library. I'm adding to this project to GitHub to give visibility into old projects, but I do not intend continuing to work on this project. It is free for anybody to clone and edit. 

The engine is fully functioning, and can be tested with the SideScroller.exe in the Debug subfolder. 

The project was originally to create a Terraria clone, but I realized it was too large of a project for a single person. Although I narrowed the scope, there is still large portions of the code dedicated to being a game. I don't plan on cleaning up the code base, but the majority of the code is purely the engine.
